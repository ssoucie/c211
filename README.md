# How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Design Recipe
## by Sam Soucie

This repo serves as a collection of (verbose) notes about C211.

My goal is to create a sort of textbook utilizing the Design Recipe based on examples that explain my actual thought process
when solving said examples.

I would suggest reading the .md files and downloading the .rkt files in order to run and play around with the code.

Special thanks to Ken Shan for acting as an editor for these notes.
