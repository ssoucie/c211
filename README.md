# Extra C211 Notes
## by Sam Soucie

This repo serves as a collection of (verbose) notes about C211.

My goal is to create a sort of textbook utilizing the Design Recipe based on examples that explain my actual thought process
when solving said examples.

Special thanks to Ken Shan for acting as an editor for these notes.
